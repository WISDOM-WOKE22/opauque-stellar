# Contributing to Opaque (Stellar)

Thanks for contributing. Opaque handles **private payments**, **on-chain ZK
reputation**, and a **shielded privacy pool**, so correctness and reproducibility
are not optional. This guide describes the exact bar every change must clear, how
the repository is laid out, and the workflow we expect. Running the checks below
locally before you push is the fastest way to keep your PR mergeable.

> **Golden rule:** no change may break `main`. Every commit on `main` must build,
> pass all tests, lint clean, and keep the deployment and artifact manifests
> verifiable.

We work in good faith. Be respectful in issues and reviews, assume the best of
other contributors, keep discussion technical, and prefer small, well-explained
changes over large unexplained ones.

## 1. How the system fits together

Before changing anything, it helps to know the moving parts and how they depend on
each other:

- **Contracts** (`contracts/`) hold the on-chain state: stealth announcements, the
  schema and attestation registries, the Groth16 and reputation verifiers, and the
  privacy pool.
- **Scanner** (`scanner/`) is the DKSAP stealth-address scanner, compiled to WASM
  and consumed by the frontend and the SDK. It reads the contract event ABI, so the
  two are tightly coupled.
- **Circuits** (`circuits/`) are the Circom Groth16 circuits whose verifying keys
  are bound into the on-chain verifier and the artifact manifest.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`), **SDK** (`sdk/`), **relayer** (`relayer/`), **ASP**
  service (`asp/`), and **publisher** (`publisher/`) are the clients and services
  built on top of the contracts.
- **Deployments** (`deployments/`) and **artifacts** (`artifacts/`) are the source of
  truth for deployed addresses and pinned binary hashes. Many checks exist purely to
  keep these honest.

The recurring theme: the scanner, circuits, and contracts must stay in lockstep, and
every binary that ships (scanner WASM, circuit keys) is hash-pinned.

---

## 2. Project layout

| Path | What it is | Toolchain |
|:-----|:-----------|:----------|
| `contracts/` | Soroban smart contracts and shared crates (Cargo workspace). The deployable set is declared in `soroban.toml`. | Rust + Stellar CLI |
| `scanner/` | DKSAP stealth-address scanner compiled to WASM | Rust + wasm-pack |
| `circuits/` | Circom Groth16 circuits and regression fixtures | Node + circom + snarkjs |
| `frontend/` | React/TypeScript reference wallet UI | Node + Vite |
| `sdk/` | TypeScript client SDK, published as `@opaquecash/stellar` | Node + tsup |
| `relayer/` | Relayer market service (`@opaquecash/relayer`) | Node |
| `asp/` | Association Set Provider service (`@opaquecash/asp`) | Node |
| `publisher/` | Reputation root publisher service (`@opaquecash/reputation-publisher`) | Node |
| `scripts/` | TypeScript tooling (deploy, verify, artifacts), run via `tsx` | Node + tsx |
| `deployments/` | Canonical contract manifests (source of truth) | JSON |
| `artifacts/` | Pinned artifact manifest (scanner WASM and circuit hashes) | JSON |

See [`scripts/README.md`](../scripts/README.md) for a complete index of maintenance
scripts, their purpose, usage, and whether they are release- or deploy-critical.

## 3. Prerequisites

### Supported versions

The CI matrix (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) tests against these exact versions.
Contributors should reproduce failures locally with the same combo before pushing.
The **Job** column names the `ci.yml` job that pins each version, so you can tell
which combination a given failure came from.

| Component | Tool | Versions tested | Job |
|-----------|------|-----------------|-----|
| Frontend | Node.js | **20**, **22** | `frontend` |
| SDK | Node.js | **20** | `sdk` |
| Circuits | Node.js | **20** | `circuits` |
| Supply chain / notices / a11y | Node.js | **20** | `supply-chain`, plus the standalone workflows |
| Services (`relayer`, `asp`, `publisher`) | Docker image build | n/a — **no Node version matrix** | `service-images` |
| Contracts + poseidon crates | Rust | **stable** | `contracts`, `poseidon-crates` |
| Scanner | Rust | **1.94.1** (pinned by `scanner/rust-toolchain.toml`, not `stable`) | `scanner`, `scanner-crate` |
| Scanner WASM target | wasm32 | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | `scanner`, `scanner-benchmark-gate` |
| Contracts WASM target | wasm32 | `wasm32v1-none` | `contracts-reproducible-build.yml` |

Two things worth internalising:

- **Node 22 is tested for the frontend only.** Every other Node job runs on 20.
- **The scanner is not on `stable`.** `scanner/rust-toolchain.toml` pins 1.94.1, and
  the scanner WASM build passes `--mode no-install` to `wasm-pack` specifically so
  the pinned toolchain produces the bytes `artifacts/manifest.json` expects. Building
  the scanner on a different Rust version changes the output hash and fails the
  artifact check.

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) with both WASM targets:
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown wasm32v1-none
  rustup component add rustfmt clippy
  ```
  (`wasm32-unknown-unknown` builds the scanner; `wasm32v1-none` builds the contracts.)
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup).
  You can install a pinned version via `scripts/install-stellar-cli.sh` for a
  matching toolchain.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **20**, or **22** (LTS) for frontend work. Other
  major versions are not tested in CI and may break.
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) 0.14.0 for the scanner
  (`scripts/install-wasm-pack.sh` installs the pinned version).
- `cargo-audit` and `cargo-deny` for supply-chain checks:
  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-audit cargo-deny --locked
  ```
- For circuit work only: [circom](https://docs.circom.io/) and `snarkjs`. The
  regression job is heavy, so most contributors will not need a local circom.

---

## 4. First-time setup

> **Full walkthrough:** [`docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`](../docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md)
> covers fresh-clone setup, environment variables, generated artifacts, and a
> troubleshooting section. The summary below matches the full guide.

Each Node workspace pins its dependencies with a lockfile and must be installed with
`npm ci` (not `npm install`) so you match the lockfile exactly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/collinsadi/opaque-stellar.git
cd opaque-stellar

npm ci                       # root tooling (tsx, typescript)
( cd frontend && npm ci )
( cd sdk && npm ci )
( cd relayer && npm ci )
( cd asp && npm ci )
( cd circuits && npm ci )    # only needed for circuit work

cp .env.example .env         # set STELLAR_NETWORK and STELLAR_DEPLOYER

npm run build:scanner        # produces the WASM the frontend/SDK consume
```

A good smoke test that your environment is sane:

```bash
cargo test --workspace --locked
npm run verify:deployment
npx tsx scripts/verify-artifact-manifest.ts --scanner --strict
```

---

## 5. Branching and commits

- Branch from `main`: `feat/<short-name>`, `fix/<short-name>`, `docs/<short-name>`,
  or `chore/<short-name>`.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for PR commits:
  `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`. Example:
  `fix(scanner): reject non-compressed ephemeral keys`.
- Keep PRs focused and small. One logical change per PR makes review and rollback
  easy.
- Write the "why" in the body, not just the "what". Link the issue you are closing.
- **Never** commit secrets, raw seeds (`S...`), `.env` files, or large build
  artifacts (zkeys, WASM blobs, `target/`). These are gitignored. Keep it that way.

> **Hash-pinned sources have no free changes.** The scanner WASM and the circuit
> keys are pinned by hash in `artifacts/manifest.json`. A rebuild is not guaranteed
> to be byte-identical, so even a comment-only edit to `scanner/` source can change
> the produced binary and fail the artifact check. Do not push cosmetic or "refresh"
> commits to hash-pinned sources. If you genuinely change that code, update the
> manifest in the same PR (see Section 7.2).

---

## 6. The required checks (must pass before pushing)

Most of the checks below run automatically on every PR via
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](workflows/ci.yml), which tests each component against the
supported version combos (see § 3) so a failure names the exact version and you can
reproduce it locally. Run the checks relevant to your change locally before you push.
Not everything lives in `ci.yml`, and several jobs are gated on changed paths:

- Checks in other workflows: `contracts-reproducible-build.yml` (`stellar contract
  build` + WASM hash comparison), `accessibility-audit.yml`, `license-compliance.yml`,
  `codeql.yml`, and `dependency-audit.yml` (§ 12).
- **Path-gated jobs in `ci.yml`** skip entirely unless you touch their paths, so a
  green run does not mean they were exercised: `circuits` (`circuits/**`),
  `scanner-crate` (`scanner/**`), and `poseidon-crates`
  (`contracts/opaque-poseidon/**`, `contracts/poseidon-bench/**`). If your change
  touches one of those, run that job's commands locally — CI will not tell you it
  passed.
- `sdk`, `service-images`, `workflow-lint`, and `supply-chain` are unconditioned.

A root `Makefile` wraps every command below so you do not have to memorise flags.
Run `make help` to see all targets, or `make ci` to run all offline checks at once.
See [`docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`](../docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full
setup guide and troubleshooting section.

### 6a. Contracts (Rust workspace)

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check                              # formatting
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings   # zero warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked                         # unit + property tests
```

The `poseidon-crates` job runs the same three commands separately in
`contracts/opaque-poseidon/` and `contracts/poseidon-bench/`, but only when those
paths change. The release WASM build (`stellar contract build`) and the
`wasm32v1-none` hash comparison are **not** in `ci.yml` — they run in
[`contracts-reproducible-build.yml`](workflows/contracts-reproducible-build.yml)
inside the pinned image (see § 7.1).

- **Warnings are errors.** Clippy runs with `-D warnings`. Do not introduce new ones.
- If you must silence a lint, do it narrowly (`#[allow(...)]` on the item) with a
  comment explaining why. Never broaden it to the crate unless a macro expansion
  genuinely forces it (for example `#[contractimpl]` argument counts).
- **Do not delete or weaken a test to make the checks pass.** If a test encodes an
  expectation that no longer matches intended behavior, either fix the code or mark
  the test `#[ignore = "<reason + tracking note>"]` and call it out in the PR
  description. Ignored tests must be justified.

### 6b. Scanner (WASM)

```bash
npm run build:scanner
npx tsx scripts/verify-artifact-manifest.ts --scanner --strict
npx tsx scripts/verify-artifact-manifest.ts --vk-binding --strict
npx tsx scripts/check-scanner-byte-stability.ts
```

The last two are separate CI steps and are easy to miss: the vk-binding check
verifies the verifying keys embedded in the contracts still match the manifest, and
the byte-stability check rebuilds and compares hashes to catch a build that is not
reproducible. The `scanner-crate` job additionally runs fmt/clippy/test inside
`scanner/`, but only on `scanner/**` changes.

Build on the pinned `scanner/rust-toolchain.toml` toolchain (1.94.1), not `stable` —
the hash pinned in `artifacts/manifest.json` was produced by that version. If you
change scanner code, rebuild and update the manifest in the **same** PR (see § 7.2).

### 6c. Circuits

```bash
npm run test:circuits     # deterministic regression fixtures
```

CI runs this as `npx tsx circuits/test/regression.ts --witness-only`, and **only on
`circuits/**` changes**. It is a witness-only pass, so it does not compile the
circuits; if you changed circuit logic, follow § 7.3 rather than relying on this
check alone.

Circuit logic changes require regenerating fixtures and updating the artifact
manifest and verifying-key binding. Large artifacts are fetched from releases, never
committed.

### 6d. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run lint              # ESLint, zero errors
npx tsc -b --noEmit       # typecheck
npm test                  # vitest run
npm run build             # production build
```

CI runs lint, typecheck, test, and build on **Node 20 and Node 22** — this is the
only component tested on both. The `accessibility-audit.yml` workflow adds a
Playwright/axe-core audit on `frontend/**` changes (see § 13).

### 6e. SDK

Run from `sdk/`:

```bash
cd sdk
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run check:exports     # publint + are-the-types-wrong
npm test
```

CI additionally runs `npm run lint` and an address-drift gate
(`npx tsx scripts/generate-sdk-addresses.ts --check`) that fails if
`sdk/src/config/addresses.ts` has drifted from the deployment manifests — commit the
regenerated file with any deploy that changes contract IDs (§ 8). The SDK job is
**Node 20 only**, not on the 20/22 matrix.

### 6f. Services (relayer, ASP, publisher)

```bash
( cd relayer   && npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm test )
( cd asp       && npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm test )
( cd publisher && npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm test )
```

**CI does not run these.** There is no typecheck or test job for the services in any
workflow. The only service job in `ci.yml` is `service-images`, which builds the
`asp`, `publisher`, and `relayer` Docker images and asserts each runs as a non-root
user with a `HEALTHCHECK` declared. So service typecheck and unit tests are
maintainer-run (`make test-relayer test-asp test-publisher`, all included in
`make ci`) and are **not** PR-blocking — keep them green regardless, since nothing
else will catch a regression.

### 6g. Supply chain and manifests

```bash
npm run verify:deployment           # manifest schema + no legacy Solana/devnet refs
cargo audit
cargo deny check
```

The `supply-chain` job in `ci.yml` runs `cargo audit` and `cargo deny check` on every
PR; its two `npm audit` steps are `continue-on-error: true` and **cannot** fail a PR.
`cargo deny check licenses` and `notices:verify` live in `license-compliance.yml`
(§ 13), and the `scanner-audit` job in `dependency-audit.yml` is PR-blocking (§ 12).

---

## 7. Component-specific guidance

### 7.1 Changing contracts

- The Soroban event ABI (topics and versions) is consumed by the scanner. **Do not
  change event shapes** without updating the scanner and bumping the event version.
- Storage key derivation is consensus-critical. Changing it is a breaking change and
  requires a redeploy plus a manifest update.
- After any contract change that affects bytecode, rebuild and update the WASM hashes
  in the relevant `deployments/v1/<network>.json` manifest.
- `attestation-engine-v2`, `privacy-pool`, `reputation-verifier`, and
  `relayer-registry` are meant to be administered through the
  `multisig-admin` contract (see
  [docs/MULTISIG_ADMIN.md](../docs/MULTISIG_ADMIN.md)), not a single key. A
  new admin-gated function on any of them should follow the same
  `caller.require_auth()` + `caller == config.admin` pattern the existing
  ones use, so it works unchanged whether `admin` is a single account or a
  deployed multisig.
- Contract WASM is built inside a pinned, checksum-verified Docker image so
  the bytes are reproducible across machines and CI
  (`docker/reproducible-build.Dockerfile`). CI
  (`.github/workflows/contracts-reproducible-build.yml`) rebuilds the
  workspace in that image on every PR touching `contracts/**` and fails if
  the hash doesn't match `deployments/v1/<network>.json`. See
  [docs/REPRODUCIBLE_BUILDS.md](../docs/REPRODUCIBLE_BUILDS.md) — release
  managers must reproduce a build from that image before signing off on a
  mainnet deploy.

### 7.2 Changing the scanner

The scanner is the most reproducibility-sensitive component because its WASM is
hash-pinned. When you make a real change:

```bash
npm run build:scanner                 # rebuild the WASM
npm run update:manifest-wasm          # refresh the pinned hashes in artifacts/manifest.json
npx tsx scripts/verify-artifact-manifest.ts --scanner --strict   # confirm it passes
```

Commit the regenerated `artifacts/manifest.json` alongside the source change in the
same PR. If a change to scanner code is not meant to alter behavior, confirm the
verify step still passes before you push, because the build may not be byte-stable.

### 7.3 Changing circuits

**Any PR that adds or modifies a `.circom` file must complete
[`docs/CIRCUIT_SOUNDNESS_CHECKLIST.md`](../docs/CIRCUIT_SOUNDNESS_CHECKLIST.md)
and paste the filled-in checklist into the PR description before requesting
review** (see the Pull Request checklist in Section 9). This is required in
addition to, not instead of, the checks below — the checklist catches
under-constrained signals, missing range checks, and public-input-binding
gaps that compiling and passing the existing tests will not surface.

Before building, confirm your local toolchain matches the pinned circom /
snarkjs / Node versions:

```bash
( cd circuits && npm run check:toolchain )
```

This fails fast with the expected-vs-actual versions and an install
pointer if your `circom`, `snarkjs`, or Node major version doesn't match
[`circuits/TOOLCHAIN.json`](../circuits/TOOLCHAIN.json) — a circuit
compiled with the wrong `circom`/`snarkjs` version can silently produce a
build that is not byte-compatible with the pinned artifacts even when every
test still passes locally.

Then regenerate fixtures and re-verify the artifact manifest:

```bash
( cd circuits && npm run fixtures:generate )
npm run test:circuits
npm run verify:artifacts
```

Remember that the `circuits` CI job is **witness-only** (`--witness-only`, no
`circom` compile) and only runs on `circuits/**` changes, so the compile-and-fixture
path above is yours to verify locally — CI will not catch a toolchain drift on its
own. Verifying-key changes must be reflected in both the artifact manifest and the
on-chain verifier binding.

### 7.4 Frontend

The frontend consumes the scanner WASM and the deployment manifests through a
prebuild step (`prepare-frontend-artifacts`). If you changed the scanner or a
manifest, rebuild the scanner first so the frontend picks up the new artifact.

### 7.5 SDK

The SDK is published to npm as `@opaquecash/stellar`. Public API changes need a
changeset (`npm run changeset`) and must keep `npm run check:exports` green so the
published types and entry points stay correct.

### 7.6 Services

The relayer market (`relayer/`), the Association Set Provider (`asp/`), and the
reputation publisher (`publisher/`) are Node services. Keep `typecheck` and `test`
green — **no workflow runs them**, so nothing in CI will catch a regression (see
§ 6f); `relayer` and `asp` also have smoke scripts (for example `npm run smoke:market`
in the relayer) for manual end-to-end checks.

Testnet operations for these services are held to the
SLOs in [`docs/testnet-slos.md`](../docs/testnet-slos.md), measured by `npm run
slo:report`. A change that materially affects publish/completion latency should call
that out in the PR description.

---

## 8. Deploying (maintainers)

Deployment is a single command driven entirely by the root `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env                # set STELLAR_NETWORK + STELLAR_DEPLOYER
npm run deploy:testnet              # build + deploy + update manifest
npm run deploy:testnet -- --dry-run # preview (no broadcast)
```

- **Mainnet requires audit signoff.** `npm run deploy:mainnet` runs the
  `verify-security-audit` gate. Do not bypass it with `--force` for real deploys.
- After deploying, regenerate the SDK address constants so the published SDK
  points at the new contract IDs:
  ```bash
  npm run generate:addresses
  ```
- Commit both the updated manifest and the regenerated `sdk/src/config/addresses.ts`.
- Verify the manifest:
  ```bash
  npx tsx scripts/verify-deployment-manifest.ts --network <net> --strict --check-wasm
  ```

---

## 9. Pull request process

1. Open a PR against `main` and fill in the template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`).
2. Confirm the checklist below.
3. `@collinsadi` reviews everything; the consensus-critical paths (`contracts/`,
   `scanner/`, `circuits/`, `deployments/`, `scripts/`) call for extra care.
4. PRs are squash-merged to keep `main` history linear.

### Checklist

- [ ] All Section 6 checks relevant to your change pass locally.
- [ ] No secrets, `.env`, or build artifacts added.
- [ ] Tests added or updated for new behavior (no deleted or weakened tests without
      justification).
- [ ] Manifests and artifact hashes updated if contracts, scanner, or circuits
      changed.
- [ ] `npm run generate:addresses` run and `sdk/src/config/addresses.ts` committed
      after any deploy that changes contract IDs.
- [ ] Event ABI or storage layout changes are matched by a scanner update and a
      version bump.
- [ ] Conventional-commit messages, and a PR description that explains the "why".
- [ ] Docs or README updated if behavior or commands changed.
- [ ] **If this PR touches a `.circom` file:** the filled-in
      [`docs/CIRCUIT_SOUNDNESS_CHECKLIST.md`](../docs/CIRCUIT_SOUNDNESS_CHECKLIST.md)
      is pasted into this PR's description.

---

## 10. Reporting bugs and proposing changes

- **Bugs:** open a GitHub issue with steps to reproduce, the affected component and
  commit or deployment, expected versus actual behavior, and any logs. A failing
  test or minimal repro is the fastest path to a fix.
- **Features and design changes:** open an issue describing the problem and your
  proposed approach before writing a large PR, especially for anything touching the
  event ABI, storage layout, circuits, or the privacy pool. Aligning early avoids
  rework.
- **Security issues:** do not use public issues. Follow Section 11.

---

## 11. Security

Do **not** open public issues for vulnerabilities. Follow the disclosure process in
[`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md). See [`DISCLAIMER.md`](../DISCLAIMER.md) for the
experimental status and privacy limitations of this software.

---

## 12. Dependency update policy

Dependencies (Rust crates, npm packages in `/` and `frontend/`, GitHub Actions)
are kept current on a stated cadence instead of ad hoc, so security patches
don't lag and upgrades don't pile up into risky big-bang bumps.

### Response windows by advisory severity

| Severity | Response window | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Critical | Patch within 24–48h of advisory publication | Out-of-band PR; does not wait for the next routine batch |
| High | Patch within 7 days | Out-of-band PR if the next routine batch is more than 7 days away |
| Medium | Patch within 30 days | Bundled into the next routine batch unless actively exploited |
| Low / informational | Next routine batch | No dedicated SLA |

Within [`dependency-audit.yml`](workflows/dependency-audit.yml), the `cargo-audit`
and `npm-audit` jobs are weekly-scheduled and non-PR-blocking: they run
`cargo audit` / `cargo deny check` and `npm audit` across the root and `frontend/`
workspaces, so an advisory published against an already-merged dependency is still
caught within the windows above instead of going unnoticed indefinitely. Wiring
routine dependency scanning itself into PR-blocking CI remains a natural follow-up.
The one exception is the `scanner-audit` job, which *is* PR-blocking — see the
next section. See Section 13 for the full workflow table.

[`dependabot.yml`](dependabot.yml) opens security-update pull requests
immediately on advisory publication, independent of the batching schedule
below.

### Rust WASM build chain (`scanner/`, compiled with wasm-pack)

The `scanner/` crate is **not** part of the contracts workspace, so its
dependency tree is monitored separately (#486). The
[`dependency-audit.yml`](workflows/dependency-audit.yml) `scanner-audit` job
runs `cargo audit` **on every pull request** (PR-blocking) as well as on the
weekly schedule, so a vulnerable build dependency cannot reach `main`
unnoticed.

- **wasm-bindgen advisories are explicitly tracked.** A dedicated step in the
  `scanner-audit` job checks `wasm-bindgen` and its direct macro/backend crates
  and fails the PR if any advisory is present, so they are never buried in a
  broader audit pass.
- **Triaged within SLA.** Advisories surfaced by `scanner-audit` follow the
  same response windows in the table above (Critical 24–48h, High 7 days, etc.).
  Because the job is PR-blocking, a Critical/High finding must be resolved or
  have an accepted `cargo audit --ignore` exception (recorded in
  `scanner/deny.toml` or an ignore file with a justification) before merge.
- **Local equivalent.** Maintainers can reproduce the check before pushing:
  `cd scanner && cargo install cargo-audit --locked && cargo audit`.

The full supply-chain policy — hash-pinning of scanner WASM and circuit
artifacts, reproducible builds, and the manifest verification gate — is
documented in [`docs/supply-chain-policy.md`](../docs/supply-chain-policy.md).

### Batching strategy per workspace

Routine (non-security) version updates are batched monthly per workspace via
`dependabot.yml`, grouped into a single PR per ecosystem where possible:

- **`cargo` (workspace root)** — monthly, minor/patch updates grouped into
  one PR. `soroban-sdk` is excluded from grouping and always opens its own
  PR: it's pinned to an exact version (`soroban-sdk = "=25.3.1"` in
  `Cargo.toml`) because a bump can change contract ABI/event behavior (see
  § 7.1), so it needs deliberate review rather than a silent batch bump.
- **`npm` (root, `frontend/`)** — monthly, minor/patch updates grouped per
  workspace into one PR each.
- **`github-actions`** — monthly.

Every dependency-update PR, batched or out-of-band, must still pass the full
Section 6 check suite before merge — batching reduces PR *count*, not review
rigor.

## 13. Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/` today has:

| Workflow | Trigger | Blocking? | What it checks |
|:---------|:--------|:----------|:----------------|
| [`ci.yml`](workflows/ci.yml) | Every PR to `main`, every push to `main` | Yes | The main matrix (§ 6): frontend, contracts, circuits, scanner, scanner benchmark gate, poseidon crates, SDK, service images, and supply chain. The `circuits`, `scanner`, `scanner-crate`, `scanner-benchmark-gate`, `poseidon-crates`, `sdk`, `service-images`, `supply-chain`, and `backup-scripts` jobs are path-gated (see *Path filters in `ci.yml`* below). |
| [`dependency-audit.yml`](workflows/dependency-audit.yml) | Every PR to `main`, weekly schedule, manual | **Partly** | `cargo audit` / `cargo deny check` / `npm audit` across root + `frontend/` run on the schedule / manual dispatch only (PRs get them from `ci.yml`'s `supply-chain` job, so each event runs them once; § 12). The `scanner-audit` job — including the explicit wasm-bindgen advisory check — **is** PR-blocking. |
| [`codeql.yml`](workflows/codeql.yml) | Every PR to `main`, weekly schedule, manual | No (reports alerts) | CodeQL `security-extended` static analysis for `javascript-typescript` and `rust`. Alert triage responsibilities are in [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md). |

#### Path filters in `ci.yml`

A `changes` job (`dorny/paths-filter`) decides which areas a change touches. The
path-scoped jobs always start, so their check names always report and required
status checks are satisfied on skipped runs, but they skip all their steps when
none of their inputs changed. (Workflow-level `paths:` is not used in `ci.yml`
because a workflow skipped that way leaves required checks pending.) Every job
also runs in full when `ci.yml` itself changes.

| Job | Runs its steps when these change |
|:----|:---------------------------------|
| `circuits` | `circuits/**` |
| `scanner` (WASM + manifest checks) | `scanner/**`, `artifacts/**`, `circuits/**`, `deployments/**`, root `package*.json`, the build/verify/manifest scripts under `scripts/` |
| `scanner-crate` | `scanner/**` |
| `scanner-benchmark-gate` | `scanner/**`, `sdk/**`, `scripts/install-wasm-pack.sh` |
| `poseidon-crates` | `contracts/opaque-poseidon/**`, `contracts/poseidon-bench/**` |
| `sdk` | `sdk/**`, `scanner/**`, `deployments/**`, root `package*.json`, `scripts/generate-sdk-addresses.ts` |
| `service-images` | `asp/**`, `publisher/**`, `relayer/**`, `deployments/**`, `.dockerignore` |
| `supply-chain` | any `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`, `deny.toml`, any `package.json`/`package-lock.json` |
| `backup-scripts` | `scripts/opaque-backup`, `scripts/opaque-verify-backup`, `scripts/test-opaque-backup.sh` |

`frontend`, `contracts`, and `workflow-lint` still run on every PR. Advisories
published against unchanged dependencies are caught by the weekly
`dependency-audit.yml` schedule.

The `contracts-reproducible-build.yml`, `license-compliance.yml`, and
`accessibility-audit.yml` workflows are scoped to the paths they actually validate,
so an unrelated change (docs-only, for example) won't run or block on them.

### Third-party notices (license compliance)

If you add, remove, or upgrade a dependency that ends up in a *distributed
binary* — a Rust crate pulled into `contracts/` or `scanner/`, anything in
`circuits/`'s devDependencies (its output ships as circuit artifacts even
though the npm package itself doesn't), or a `frontend/` production
dependency — regenerate the notices file in the same PR:

```bash
npm run notices:generate
git add THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md
```

If the new dependency's license isn't in the permissive allow list (see
`PERMISSIVE_LICENSES` in `scripts/third-party-notices-lib.ts`), `npm run
notices:verify` (and CI) will fail until a maintainer adds a reviewed entry
to `REVIEWED_NON_PERMISSIVE` in that same file explaining why it's safe to
bundle. Don't add that entry yourself for a dependency you're introducing —
flag it in the PR description and let a maintainer make the call. See
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and issue #148 for the
broader compliance tracking scope this fits into.

## 14. Stale issue and PR policy

With 150+ open issues, unattended backlog grows unbounded without automated
triage. [`stale.yml`](workflows/stale.yml) (`actions/stale`) runs daily:

- **Issues:** marked `stale` after 60 days with no activity, closed 14 days
  after that if still untouched.
- **Pull requests:** marked `stale` after 30 days with no activity, closed 14
  days after that. Draft PRs are exempt from the start — they're usually
  still being shaped.
- Any comment or new commit clears the `stale` label automatically.

**`P0` and `P1` are always exempt** — priority issues and PRs in progress
never auto-stale or auto-close, regardless of how long they sit, because
silence on a P0/P1 usually means it's blocked on something external, not
abandoned.

**Maintainers can exempt anything else** by applying the `no-stale` label
(or `pinned`, for issues meant to stay open indefinitely, e.g. tracking
issues). Apply it proactively to anything you know is still relevant but
will plausibly go quiet for a while.

If the bot closes something that's still relevant, reopen it (or open a
fresh issue/PR referencing the old one) — closing via staleness is not a
judgment that the report was wrong, only that it went quiet.
